		<DT><B>Instructions for building an executable with the Internet Toolkit G Web Server with 
		CGI:</B></A></DT><P>
		<DD>	1. Select <B>Tools » Build Application or Shared Library (DLL).</B>
		<DD>	2. Select a location for the executable to be built (Destination directory).
		<DD>	3. Select <B>Single target file containing all VIs</B> from the <B>Build Options</B> 
		list.
		<DD>	4. Add the Top-Level VI and Dynamic VIs (be sure to include all user CGI VIs as dynamic VIs).
		<DD>	5. Select the <B>VI Settings</B> tab and select <B>Edit Build Setting</B> for each user CGI
		VI. Set Remove Panel to NO for each VI (if necessary).
		<DD>	6. Add the configuration files from internet\http\conf directory as support files 
		and change the custom destination to be <code>&lt;Destination directory&gt;\internet\http\conf\</code>.
		<DD>	7. Build the executable.
		<DD>	8. Exit the Application Builder by pressing the <B>Done</B> button.
		<DD>	9. Edit DocumentRoot in the srm.cfg file (from the built application, not the original) 
		to be the location of the application's home directory. (The directory out of which you will serve 
		your documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory. Normally this is the 
		application directory plus /www.)
		<DD>	10. Make sure that the ScriptAlias line near the bottom of scm.cfg file (from the built 
		application, not the original) is uncommented (remove the #).
		<DD>	11. Edit the lvhttp.cfg file (from the built application, not the original) so that UseDNS 
		is set to ON.
		<DD>	12. To run the GWS in module mode, make sure that the ini file has the following tokens 
		set to True, and for standalone mode, make sure they are set to false 
		Webserver.Enabled=False 
		InternetToolkitInstalled=False 
		<DD>	13. Run the application. Note that you need to set the operation control to "start" and run the G Web Server Control VI to start the G Web Server.
		<DD>	14. To get to the CGI VI, type in http://yourservername:portyouused/cgi-bin/VIName.vi 
		in your browser.
