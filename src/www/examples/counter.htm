<H2>Counter CGI</H2>
<P>Often people embed an image in their page that shows how many times this page
has been accessed. This image is generated by a CGI application that keeps track
of how many times a URL has been hit.<BR>
<BR>
The following embedded image has been generated by a CGI that takes a single parameter
and returns an image showing how many time it has been called with this parameter.
The HTML code for the image is<BR>
<BR>
<TT>&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/cgi-bin/counter.vi?/cgi-bin/examples/counter.htm&quot;&gt;<BR>
</TT><BR>
<IMG SRC="/cgi-bin/examples/counter.vi?/cgi-bin/examples/counter.htm" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0"> <BR>
<BR>
When you reload the page, the CGI is called again and the number in the image is
incremented.<BR>
